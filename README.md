# Grocery store website: Green Grocers
This is my final project submission for the Microsoft Future Ready Talent Internship. Created a grocery web app.

I deployed the code on Static Web App Azure service. Here is the link: https://gentle-coast-09f24e810.1.azurestaticapps.net/

Project Description: Online grocery shopping is a dream come true for today’s generation. Specially, for all those women/men who always wanted to do grocery shopping on a budget. The landscape of grocery fulfillment has changed greatly. It saves time
shopping online and the need to walk up and down store aisles. And they can log in any time even at 2 am and still have the advantage of a fully stocked store. Plus, going the delivery route saves their trip to the store, which not only saves time, but physical transport money as well. In fact, studies show grocery delivery services slash carbon dioxide emissions in half compared to individual household trips. 

To get to access my online grocoery shopping system all the customers will need to have an email and password to login and proceed with their shopping. The login credentials for an online shopping system are under high security and nobody will have the capacity to crack it easily. Upon successful login the customers can purchase a wide range of things such as fresh fruits, vegetables, organic spices, meat, wheat, milk etc. The products will be dispatched using online shopping system. And of course they will get their requested ordered items at their doorstep. And, Yes the project’s purpose and basic functionality is mapped to the problem statement/opportunity area.

Here are some of the screenshots of the project:
